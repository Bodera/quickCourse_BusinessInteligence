# Selecting a data warehouse system

Goals of this section:

- Identify criteria organizations can use to evaluate data warehouse systems.
- Describe key considerations for each data warehouse selection criteria.
- Summarize how organizations decide between an on-premises or a public cloud data warehouse system.
- List the various types of data warehouse costs.

## Evaluating data warehouse systems

Let's look at the criteria businesses use to evaluate data warehouse systems, including:

- Features and capabilities compatibility
- Implementation considerations
- Ease of use and required skills
- Support
- The types of costs

### Features and capabilities compatibility

One of the primary data warehouse features, or considerations, for an organization is location. Dara warehouses can exist on-premises, on appliances, and on one or more cloud locations.

To select a location, organizations must balance multiple demands related to data ingestion, storage, and access. For some organizations, securing their data is their highest priority, requiring a mandatory on-premises solution. Multi-location businesses that grapple with data privacy requirements such as CCPA or GDPR need on-premises or geo-specific data warehouse locations.

Every organization balances security and data privacy requirements with the need for speed that delivers critical, profit-producing business insights.

Organizations will also want to consider features and capabilities related to architecture and structure. Is the organization ready to commit to a vendor-specific architecture? Does the organization need multi-cloud installation such as multiple data warehouses in multiple locations? Does the solution scale to meet anticipated future needs? What data types are supported and what types of data does the organization ingest? If your organization currently analyzes dark data or is planning for the implementation of semi-structured and unstructured data, you'll want a data warehouse system that supports these data types. And an organization that processes big data needs a system that supports both batch and streaming data.

### Implementation considerations

Capabilities that affect ease of implementation include data governance, data migration, and data transformation capabilities. With the data warehouse system in place, how easily can the organization optimize and reoptimize system performance as needs change?

Another consideration is user management. With more organization implementing a zero-trust security policy because of expensive data breaches, implementing programs that manage and validate system users is mandatory.

And notifications and reports are essential for organizations to correct errors and mitigate risks before minor issues become larger problems.

### Ease of use and required skills

Let's explore ease of use and skills. Does your organization's staff have the skills needed to implement a specific data warehousing vendor's technology, and if not, how quickly and easily can they gain those skills?

Complex, large data warehouse deployments can require additional work from your implementation partner, so their expertise also greatly matters.

Finally, do the technology and engineering staff who architect, deploy, and administer front-end querying, reporting, and visualization tools have the skills needed to configure you new system quickly?

### Support considerations

Support is essential and can become frustrating and expensive if not well planned for. You might find that by using a single vendor, you can leverage one highly accountable, responsible source, potentially saving you time, money and frustration.

You'll also want to verify the availability of service level agreements for uptime, security, scalability, and other data warehouse system issues.

Validate the vendor's support hours and channels, such as by phone, e-mail, chat or text.

Finally, does the vendor offer self-service solutions and an active rich user community? 

### Types of costs

After all this analysis, it's time to evaluate and compare costs.

When calculating costs for a data warehouse system, consider more than the initial costs. Consider the total cost of ownership (TCO), for running systems for several years. TCO includes: 

- Infrastructure such as compute and storage costs - whether on-premises or on cloud.
- Software licensing, or in case of cloud offerings, their subscription or usage costs.
- Data migration and integration costs for moving data into the warehouse and prunning and purging as required.
- Administration costs related to system management and personal training.
- Recurring support and maintenance costs paid to the warehousing vendor or implementation partner.

## Summary

In this section we've learned:

- Businesses evaluate data warehouse systems based on features and capabilities, compatibility and implementation, ease of use and required skills, support quality and availability, and multiple costs considerations.
- An organization might need a traditional on-premises installation to adhere to data security and privacy requirements.
- Public cloud sites offer organizations the benefits of economies of scale including powerful compute power and scalable storage, resulting in flexible price-for-performance options.
- When selecting a data warehouse system consider the total cost of ownership including infrastructure, compute and storage, data migration, administration, and data maintenance costs in your calculations.

## Bonus

Also consider analyzing the following:

- Widgets and dashboards available
- Community collaboration and engagement
- Elasticity, or high-scalability requirements
- Hybrid hosting
- Consolidation and integration of data silos
- Rapid development of line-of-business analytics products
- Management of sensitive data
- Storage of cold SQL data
- Plugins, drivers and clients support (Node.js, R Studio, Python, Apache Spark, Spring, and other APIs)
- Partitioning and remote deployment
